# AtliQ Hospitality -Dashboard

## Introduce about AtliQ
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 

## Problem Statement
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the Luxury/Business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Objective 
* Help AtliQ Grands regain its market share and revenue by leveraging Business and Data Intelligence through actionable insights from their historical data.
* Get insights where The business is facing difficulties, and you need to help them solve the problem.

## Task
- Create the metrics based on the metric list using DAX (Power BI)
- Create a dashboard to assist them in addressing the problem.

## Dataset Details
This file contains all the meta information regarding the columns described in the CSV files. We have provided 5 CSV files:
* dim_date
* dim_hotels
* dim_rooms
* fact_aggregated_bookings
* fact_bookings

# Steps to Execute 
### 1) Importing and verifying data. Transformations and cleaning in power query
* Import the data using the file path. We need create the dim and fact tables. Then, we need to transform and clean dim_date

We need to handle the dim_date table to meet the requirements of AtliQ Hotel. For them, Sunday to Thursday are considered weekdays, while Friday and Saturday are considered weekends. So we will create new _day_type_ column. The result is showed below:
* By using WEEKDAY(dim_date[date]), we can identify the days of the week. Then, we use IF to return the _day_type_. 

Here, weekday = [6,7] corresponds to Friday and Saturday.

Note: This dataset contains the hotel's business data for 3 months (from May to July), with weeks ranging from 19 to 32. However, since week 32 does not have enough data, we will exclude week 32 to avoid bias.

### 2) Data modeling

After completing the previous steps, we proceed with data modeling. The goal of data modeling is to create a clear and logical data model that helps organize and store data efficiently, which then supports data retrieval and analysis. Here, I chose the Star Schema method.

### 3) Create New Measures using DAX.
We will create measures based on the calculations mentioned by the experts in the hotel industry. They provided metrics list to us to support build dashboard.
I have attached the metrics list. If you want more details about the metrics I used in the article, you can access it to see. Here, I will talk about key metrics in the hotel industry:
* Revpav: It measures the revenue generated by each available room, helping hotels assess both occupancy rates and room pricing effectiveness.
* Occupancy %: refers to the ratio of successful bookings to the total available rooms (capacity).
* ADR (Average Daily Rate): It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.
* DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period
* DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights): This metrics tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period
* DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights): This metric tells on average how many rooms are succesfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period


### 4) Creating Dashboard using appropriate Visualization.
We create three dashboards to give the business a complete view of all aspects.

#### Overview Dashboard
First is the Overview Dashboard, which provides an overview of important information and key metrics:

**Revenue** from May to July reached 1.688M Rupees, showing a growth of 7.9% compared to the previous week.

Looking at the **Key Metrics** chart:

* **ADR**: There were no significant changes, indicating that the average hotel rate remained stable across the weeks.

* **Occupancy Rate**: However, it showed a downward trend towards the end of July, which could impact RevPAR.

* **RevPAR**: It was unstable due to fluctuations in occupancy rate.

Additionally, **weekends** have a higher occupancy rate than **weekdays**. This indicates that customers tend to travel during weekends.

Looking at the metrics table: Most property in **Hyderabad** have relatively low RevPAR.

#### Booking Dashboard

Next is the Booking Dashboard, which provides insights into the booking situation at the hotel.

Although it's summer, our hotel is welcoming a large number of customers. 133,000 bookings were recorded, but only 93,000 were successful, and nearly 30% of the remaining bookings were canceled.

* The cancellation rate is 25%, which is quite high. This reflects that the hotel is struggling to retain customers. It also impacts the Occupancy Rate, making it challenging to optimize room utilization.

For each **room class**:
* The Elite room can accommodate up to 85,000 guests (showing that this is the preferred room at the hotel), but there were only 49,000 bookings and 12,000 guests decided to cancel. This is a significant number, especially considering this room type is expected to be a main revenue source.

* On the other hand, the Standard and Premium rooms performed better, indicating that customer demand is focused on the mid-range segment. Meanwhile, the Presidential room seems to be overlooked, with a large surplus capacity and a low number of bookings.

For Platform:
* Hệ thống ghi nhận hầu hết khách hàng đều đặt phòng từ nguồn không rõ ràng (other) điều này khiến việc dự đoán và tối ưu hóa gặp khó khăn



#### Rating & Customer Dashboard
Finally, the Rating & Customer Dashboard helps the business understand customer behavior when they visit the hotel.

* The number of guests fluctuates and shows a decreasing trend in the final weeks (18.3K in week 30), indicating a decline in demand and the influence of other factors such as the low season.
* For groups of 5-6 guests, the "Standard" room class accounts for the majority of total bookings (>65%), demonstrating strong demand for this type of room.
* Properties like "Atliq Seasons" have very low ratings (2.30), which may require focusing on improving services or customer engagement.
* Delhi has the highest rating (3.78), while "Atliq Blu" achieves 3.96. This suggests that marketing strategies should focus more on these strengths.


## Solution
* **Exploring Elite Rooms:** Since our target customers are in the luxury segment, marketing campaigns focused on Elite and Presidential rooms are essential. Weekly discounts and package deals can help attract and retain luxury travelers.

* **Implementing a Dynamic Pricing:** increase Occupancy Rate as well as optimize room rate based on demand

* **Provide reschedule policy:** the policy can help AtliQ reduce cancellation rate

* **Focus on online channels:** Apply promotions on apps to encourage customers to book rooms.
